### Accessing the API

Using the below reference apis we can test the data   
API1: http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/username   
API2: http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/username/projectid 

eg:    
http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/ashishcyn   
http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/ashishcyn/project-search-api  

http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/jonlaokan  
http://localhost/project-search-api/projects/iluwatar/30-seconds-of-java   



Content negotiation is also implemened so we can pass headers as application/xml or application/json and will get the corresponding outputs(postman will be a good choice for tesing it) 

### Unit Tests
Test case results will be availbe in surefire-reports under target directory

### Continuous Integration with Git
Workflow build file is configured for Continuous Integration with GitHub. It runs the tests and build a docker image and publish to dockerub for every pull request or commit to master branch.
